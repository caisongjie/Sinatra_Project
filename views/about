bugs I have encountered:

Q1. Session not saved after redirect
Solution: write  use Rack::Session::Cookie  in main.rb

Q2. Database modeling issues
Solution: Datamapper setup, define class(model), DataMapper.finalize, DataMapper.auto_migrate!, DataMapper.auto_upgrade!

Q3. HTML5 tag <video> not supported by Firefox on Ubuntu
Solution: Nothing wrong with the code, use Chrome, then you can play the video

Q4. Students.all and Comment.all return an empty array but !@array gives false
Solution: use !@array == [] to check, or use empty?

Q5. Automate created_at for comment?
Solution: use property :created_at, DateTime, remember to require dm-timestamps
